### Overview

In the Week 9 lecture we covered multiple linear regression. 


#### Data Files

```{r echo=FALSE}

```  

## 9.1 Multiple Linear Regression

A hospital surgical unit was interested in predicting survival (measured in days) in patients undergoing a particular type of liver operation. Data for 54 patients was available for analysis. From each patient record, the following information was extracted from the pre-operation evaluation:       

  $X_1$ a blood clotting score
  
  $X_2$ a liver function test score

The data for this study can be found in the file *Lab 09 - Surgical.sav*.

#### 1. Fit a simple linear regression model explaining survival time, $Y$, based on blood clotting score, $X_1$. What is the equation of the fitted model (i.e., write the fitted equation of the linear relationship)? Does blood clotting score affect survival time?

##### Solutions

Ⓢ 

```{r}
summary(data)
lm(Survival1 ~ BloodClot, data)
```

$E(Y) = 205.3 + 85.9X_1$ where $E(Y)$ represents expected survival time and $X_1$ blood clotting score.

Blood clotting score has a statistically significant linear relationship with survival time (p = 0.01).

#### 2. Fit a simple linear regression model explaining survival time, $Y$, based on liver function test score, $X_2$. What is the equation of the fitted model? Does liver function test score affect survival time?

##### Solutions

Ⓢ 

```{r}
lm(Survival1 ~ Liver1, data)
```

$E(Y) = 15.2 + 250.3X_2$ where $E(Y)$ represents expected survival time and $X_2$ represents the liver function test score.

Liver function test score has a statistically significant linear relationship with survival time (p = 0.000).  NOTE: can report p-value as p < 0.0005

#### 3. Fit a multiple linear regression model explaining survival time, $Y$, based on both blood clotting score, $X_1$, and liver function test score, $X_2$. What is the equation of the fitted model (i.e., write the fitted equation of the linear relationship)?

##### Solutions

Ⓢ 

```{r}
lm(Survival1 ~ BloodClot + Liver1, data)
```

#### 4. Consider the regression coefficients and p-values associated with blood clotting score, $X_1$, and liver function test score, $X_2$, in this multiple regression model. Compare them with the corresponding regression coefficients in the SLR models for each. Is the information suggested by the two simple linear regression models consistent with the information provided by the multiple regression model? Why not?  Hint: Create a scatter plot showing the relationship between $X_1$ and $X_2$. What does this mean? How might this affect the multiple regression analysis?

##### Solutions

Ⓢ 

The $Y$ by $X_1$ model suggests a statistically significant linear relationship (p = 0.01) with survival time increasing by 85.9 days on average for every increase of 1 unit in blood clotting score. This doesn’t appear consistent with the $Y$ by $X_1$ and $X_2$ model where survival time increases by only 2.6 days on average for every increase of 1 unit in blood clotting score and the relationship is not statistically significant (p = 0.93).

The $Y$ by $X_2$ model suggests a statistically significant linear relationship (p < 0.001) with survival time increasing by 250.3 days on average for every increase of 1 unit in liver function test score. This is consistent with the $Y$ by $X_1$ and $X_2$ model where survival time increases by 248.4 days on average for every increase of 1 unit in liver function test score and the relationship is still statistically significant (p < 0.001).

The main problem here is multi-collinearity. $X_1$ and $X_2$ are correlated with one another.

When $X_1$ and $X_2$ vary in the same way it really isn’t possible to separate out the variation in $Y$ that is related to $X_1$ from the variation in $Y$ that is related to $X_2$. Hence in this particular sample, the relationship between survival time and blood clotting score is not captured by the multiple regression model because that part of the variation in $Y$ that could be related to $X_1$ has already been related to $X_2$. In this particular sample, it has mainly been the coefficient and p-value associated with the $X_1$ variable that have been affected but in other samples it could be the $X_2$ variable that is most affected or both variables could be similarly affected.

#### 5. Should both blood clotting score, $X_1$, and liver function test score, $X_2$ be included in a model for survival time, $Y$?

##### Solutions

Ⓢ 

It really doesn’t make much sense to include both variables in our model.

Including $X_1$ in the model doesn’t really provide any more "explaining power" than a model with just $X_2$.

#### 6. There are actually a number of other variables available in the data file including:

  $X_3$ Prognostic index;
  
  $X_4$ Enzyme function test score;
  
  $X_5$ Age, in years

We'll take the residuals from the Liver model ($E(Y) = 15.2 + 250.3X_2$), and see if any of these variables are able to explain some of the left-over variance in the data.

![](R.svg)

We can extract the residuals from the model with the `residuals()` function, and then plot each of these variables against that.

![](v.svg)

Recall that a residual is:

  observered value - expected value

We can create a 'computed variable' in jamovi, which performs this calculation for us, providing us with a column of residual values.

Data -> Add -> Computed Variable -> Append. What formula will calculate the residual for our model, for each observation? Hint: The expected value is given by the model formula.

The expected values for our Liver model are given by:

$$15.2 + 250.3 \times Liver1$$

Which means our residuals are given by:

$$Survival1 - (15.2 + 250.3 \times Liver1)$$

Note that in providing this formula to jamovi, multiplication is indicated with an asterisk:

```
Survival1 - (15.2 + 250.3 * Liver1)
```

Having computed the residuals, explore the relationship between these residuals and each of the other variables with the *Scatterplot* (Analyses -> Exploration -> Scatterplot [requires the `scatr` module to be installed]). It doesn't matter whether you put the residuals on the X-axis, or the Y-axis.

##### Solutions

Ⓢ 

```{r}
model <- lm(Survival1 ~ Liver1, data)
data$resids <- residuals(model)
plot(resids ~ BloodClot, data)
plot(resids ~ Prognostic, data)
plot(resids ~ Enzyme1, data)
plot(resids ~ Age1, data)
```

TODO, add line of fit

#### 7. Consider the scatter plot of the residuals from the $Y$ by $X_2$ model against $X_1$. Fit a line through the points. Remember that these residuals represent the unexplained variation in survival time after the effect of liver function test score on survival time has been accounted for. Does blood clotting score, $X_1$, help to explain any of this unexplained variation in $Y$? i.e. does blood clotting score explain any more of the variation in survival time than has already been explained by liver function? Can you relate this to your earlier analysis of effect of $X_1$ and $X_2$ on $Y$?

##### Solutions

Ⓢ 

Considering the first of these scatter plots, a line fitted to these data is close to horizontal and $R_2$ is basically 0. Thus $X_1$ is of very little use in helping to explain any more of the as yet unexplained variation in $Y$ which is what the residuals from our $Y$ by $X_2$ model represents. This is consistent with what we had previously decided.

#### 8. Consider the other plots of the residuals from the $Y$ by $X_2$ model against $X_3$, $X_4$ and $X_5$. Which of these variables, if any, do you think is most useful in explaining any of the unexplained variation in survival time after the effect of liver function test score has been accounted for?

Hint: Enzyme function test score, $X_4$, appears most useful; can you see why?

Hopefully creating this series of plots has given you a better idea of what multiple regression is about and also an understanding of the potential problem of multi-collinearity. We would not necessarily always go through every step of this process to decide on whether to add another variable or not but it can be useful.

A refinement of this kind of plot involving the residuals from one model against another variable is the added variable plot, sometimes called the partial regression plot. See Applied linear statistical models Kutner et al. (2005) (available in the library) for more information.

##### Solutions

Ⓢ 

Of the other variables, $X_3$ , prognostic index and $X_4$, enzyme function test score, look as if they might be useful in explaining some of the residual variation. However $X_4$ explains more of the residual variation than $X_3$. (Determined by examining $R^2$  for the line fitted to each scatter plot.)

#### 9. Fit a multiple regression model relating survival time, $Y$, to liver function test score, $X_2$, and enzyme function test score, $X_4$. What is the equation of the fitted model? Interpret the coefficients of this model.

##### Solutions

Ⓢ 

```{r}
lm(Survival1 ~ Liver1 + Enzyme1, data)
```

The equation of the fitted model is:

$$ E(Y) = −351.0 + 194.7 \times X_2 + 6.73 \times X_4 $$

This model indicates that:

 - Average survival time increases by 6.73 days for every increase of 1 unit in enzyme function test score (and no change in liver function test score).
 - Average survival time increases by 194.7 days for every increase of 1 unit in liver function test score (and no change in enzyme function test score).
 - These increases are from a base level of -351.0 days average survival time when liver function test score and enzyme function test score are both zero. Obviously a negative survival time makes no sense but the values for the explanatory variables that would produce a negative value are also outside the realistic range. This intercept term is still required to fix a base level (starting point if you like) for the survival time relationship – recall the diagram of the ‘plane’ in lectures (as opposed to ‘line’ for simple linear regression) and how it cuts the Y axis. 

#### 10. Determine the *Sum of squares* for the overall model, and for the residuals, of both the model of survival time by liver function test score and enzyme function test score ($Y$ by $X_2$ and $X_4$) and also for the simpler model of survival time by liver function test score ($Y$ by $X_2$).

To calculate the sum of squares for the overall model, simply sum the sum of squares values for all explanatory variables -- but *do not* include the residuals in this.

Note that the total sum of squares is the same for each model. Why?

```{r}
liverEnzymeModel <- lm(Survival1 ~ Liver1 + Enzyme1, data)
Anova(liverEnzymeModel, type=3)

liverModel <- lm(Survival1 ~ Liver1, data)
Anova(liverModel, type=3)
```

##### Solutions

Ⓢ 

For the $Y$ by $X_2$ and $X_4$ model: $SS_{model} = 4700277$, $SS_{error} = 3669244$, $SS_{total}  = 8369521$.
For the $Y$ by $X_2$ model: $SS_{model} = 3804273$ and $SS_{error} = 4565248$, $SS_{total} = 8369521$.

The total sum of squares is the same in each case because the data is the same and the total  sum of squares is calculated only from the values of the response variable:

$$ SS_{total} = \sum_{i=1}^n(Y_i - \bar Y)^2 $$

#### 11. Subtract *Sum of squares* for the model for the simpler $Y$ by $X_2$ model from *Sum of squares* for the model for the more complex $Y$ by $X_2$ and $X_4$ model. This is how much variation, measured in terms of sums of squares, has been shifted from *Sum of squares* for the residuals, the unexplained variation, to *Sum of squares* for the model, the explained variation, in going from the simpler $Y$ by $X_2$ model to the more complex $Y$ by $X_2$ and $X_4$ model (i.e. by adding the variable enzyme function test score). Explain how this value relates to the sums of squares given in the Test of Between-Subjects Effect Tests table.

##### Solutions

Ⓢ 

Adding the $X_4$ variable to the model has shifted variation in $Y$ equivalent to 896004 in terms of sums of squares from *Sum of squares* for the residuals, i.e., the unexplained variation, into *Sum of squares* for the model . This is exactly the value of the Type 3 sum of squares shown in the Tests of Between Subjects Effects table for the enzyme function test score variable.

#### 12. From the Test of Between-Subjects Effect Tests table, what is the sum of squares associated with the liver function test score, $X_2$? Explain how this value has been determined.

From this same table, the Type 3 sum of squares for the liver function test score, $X_2$ is 1901967. This is the extra variation in $Y$, in terms of sums of squares, that has been explained by adding the $X_2$ variable to a model already containing the $X_4$ variable. It can be determined by subtract *Sum of squares* for the model  for the simpler $Y$ by $X_4$ model from *Sum of squares* for the model for the more complex $Y$ by $X_2$ and $X_4$ model.

#### 13. Fit a multiple regression model relating survival time, $Y$, to liver function test score, $X_2$, and Enzyme function test score, $X_4$. Now include an interaction term. What is the equation of the fitted model?

```{r}
lm(Survival1 ~ Liver1 + Enzyme1 + Liver1:Enzyme1, data)
```
The equation of the fitted model is:

$$ E(Y) = 1055.436 –10.766 \times Enzyme –382.75 \times Liver +6.913 \times Enzyme \times Liver $$

#### 14. For each of the two main effects and the interaction effect, test whether the corresponding regression coefficient is equal to zero or not. In each case, give the null and alternative hypotheses (defining any symbols used), the relevant test statistic, p-value and an appropriate conclusion.

##### Solutions

Ⓢ 

For the effect of the $X_2 \times X_4$ interaction:

  $$ H_0: \beta_5 = 0 $$
  
  $$ H_a: \beta_5 \ne 0 $$

where $\beta_5$ is the population regression coefficient relating expected change in survival time to a unit change in the value of the liver function score by enzyme test score cross product term. Test  statistic t = 3.78 and associated p-value is p < 0.001.

For the effect of $X_2$:

  $$ H_0: \beta_2 = 0 $$
  
  $$ H_a: \beta_2 \ne 0 $$

where $\beta_2$ is the population regression coefficient relating change in survival time to change in the value of the liver function score. Test statistic t = 4.21 and associated p-value is p < 0.001.

For the effect of $X_4$:

  $$ H_0: \beta_4 = 0 $$
  $$ H_a: \beta_4 \ne 0 $$
  
where $\beta_4$ is the population regression coefficient relating change in survival time to change in the value of the liver function score. Test statistic, t = 4.71 and associated p-value is p < 0.001.

As well as stating that each main effect and the interaction are statistically significant, a good conclusion would include some kind of quantitative description of the model (interpretation of the coefficients). This should address the key research questions of interest in the study. Instead of a text-only description, graphs, tables or numerical equations may be used to present the results; the choice depends on the aims of the research and intended audience for report.

Interpreting interacting covariates is not straight forward. We must consider how the relationship between $Y$ and $X_4$ changes for differing values of $X_2$ (similarly for the relationship between $Y$ and $X_2$ for differing values of $X_2$).

At low values of liver function, the average survival time actually decreases with increasing enzyme test score but at high values of liver function, the average survival time increases rapidly with increasing enzyme test score. For example, at a liver function score, $X_2$ = 0.74 (low end of range):

  $$ E(Y) = 1052.5 − 382.5 \times 0.74 − 10.72X_4 + 6.91X_4 × 0.74 $$
  
  $$ = 769.5 − 5.61X_4 $$
  
Thus average survival time decreases by 5.61 days for every 1 unit increase in enzyme test score (from a level of 769.5 days when enzyme test score is zero).

At a liver function score of $X_2$ = 6.4 (high end of range):

  $$ E(Y) = 1052.5 − 382.5 \times 6.4 − 10.72X_4 + 6.91X_4 \times 6.4 $$

  $$ = −1395.5 + 33.5X_4 $$
  
Thus survival time increases on average by 33.5 days for every 1 unit increase in enzyme test score (from a level of -1395.5 days when enzyme test  score is zero). At low values of enzyme test, the average survival time actually decreases with increasing liver function test score but at high values of enzyme test, the average survival time increases rapidly with increasing liver function test score.

For example, at an enzyme test score, $X_4$ = 23 (low end of range):

  $$ E(Y) = 1052.5 − 382.5X_2 − 10.72 × 23 + 6.91 × 23 × X_2 $$
  
  $$ = 805.9 − 223.6X_2 $$
  
Thus average survival time decreases by 223.6 days for every 1 unit increase in liver function test score (from a level of 805.9 days when enzyme test score is zero).

At an enzyme test score, $X_4$ = 119 (high end of range):

  $$ E(Y) = 1052.5 − 382.5X_2 − 10.72 × 119 + 6.91 × 119 × X_2 $$
  
  $$ = −223.2 + 439.8X_2 $$

Thus average survival time increases by 439.8 days for every 1 unit increase in liver function test score (from a level of – 223.2 days when enzyme test score is zero).

Comment: Instead of the t tests quoted here, the equivalent F tests from the effect tests table could be used. Note also that it doesn’t really matter what labels you use for the regression coefficients as long as they are clearly defined. The definitions used correspond to a model:

  $$ Y = \beta_0 + \beta_2 X_2 + \beta_4 X_4 + \beta_5 X_2 X_4 + \epsilon $$

where subscripts of $\beta$ correspond with subscripts for $X$.

#### 15. Obtain 95% confidence intervals for each of the (population) regression coefficients by using the estimates and standard errors given in the Parameter Estimates table. You can then confirm your calculations using your statistical software. Provide an appropriate interpretation of each confidence interval and explain the relationship between each confidence interval and the corresponding hypothesis test conducted previously.

##### Solutions

Ⓢ 

From the extra columns in the Parameter Estimates table :

 - 95% confidence intervals for $\beta_2$ is [78.6, 222.1]
 - 95% confidence intervals for $\beta_4$ is [4.7, 11.7]
 - 95% confidence intervals for $\beta_5$ is [3.24, 10.59]
        
None of these intervals contain zero. This means that each of β2 , β4 and β5 can be considered statistically significantly different from 0 at the 5% significance level. This is consistent with the previously conducted hypothesis tests.

Note that it is quite difficult to provide a meaningful interpretation for these intervals because of the interaction effect. For example, we can’t say that we are “95% confident that the average survival time increases by between 78.6 and 222.1 days for every increase of 1 unit in liver function test score”. The interaction effect means that this is not a valid statement. Depending on what result one was trying to communicate in a report one could probably just provide some kind of description as discussed above that clearly indicates the nature of the regression model and perhaps report the standard error for each regression coefficient as well as the estimate and perhaps not use a confidence interval in this case.

#### 16. For an enzyme test score of 60 and a liver test score of 3, give the point estimate of the population average survival time, the 95% confidence interval of the population average survival time and a 95% prediction interval for an individual patient survival time.

TODO

##### Solutions

Ⓢ 

When $X_2$ = 3 and $X_4$ = 60 the estimated average survival time is 505.6 days.

Including an error margin in this estimate we can be 95% confident that the average survival time of patients with these pre-operation test scores is between 388.7 and 622.5 days. We can be 95% confident that any individual with these pre-operation test scores will survive for between 11.6 and 999.6 days. (These values have been calculated using SPSS in exactly the same way as shown for simple linear regression.)

#### 17. The diagnostic methods used for simple linear regression are also useful for multiple regression. Plot the residuals against the predicted values. Comment on the adequacy of the linear regression model fitted to the data. Also comment on the constancy of the error variance.

TODO

##### Solutions

Ⓢ 

A plot of the residuals against the predicted values is provided below.

TODO

There is perhaps some suggestion of a curved pattern in the residuals and increasing scatter at high predicted survival times but it is not definitive. This would not prove particularly concerning.

#### 18. Plot the residuals separately against the liver function and enzyme test scores. Are any curvature effects suggested by these residual plots? Does the magnitude of the error variance remain constant in relation to each of these variables?

TODO

##### Solutions

Ⓢ 

The plot below shows the residuals against the liver function and enzyme test scores. No real curvature effects are suggested by these residual plots but again there is some suggestion of non-constant variance. (It may be useful to consider a square-root or logarithmic transformation of the response but there are also some other possible explanatory variables that we should perhaps consider before a transformation in trying to build a better model.)

TODO

#### 19. Check the distribution of the residuals for normality.

TODO

##### Solutions

Ⓢ 

TODO

Figure below shows the distribution of the residuals. The histogram appears approximately bell- shaped but the low p-value of 0.03 for the Shapiro-Wilk test suggests that these residuals cannot be considered as having been sampled from a normally distributed population.

#### 20. Are there any obvious outliers evident in the residual plots? Which rows in the data set correspond to outliers?

TODO

##### Solutions

Ⓢ 

TODO

From the residual plots, observations 5, 28 and 38 are possible outliers that might be worth further study. Is there anything specific to these points that might explain why they seem to be behaving a bit differently from the others? In this exercise we are limited in being able to answer this question but in reality we would go back to our patient records and look for possible explanations. Using the data only, observations 5 and 38 are both high on the enzyme test score.

#### 21. Return to the Linear Regression platform and click on the Save button. Under Influence Statistics select Cook's D to save the Cook's distance measure for each observation; then create a histogram and boxplot of the values (Analyze → Descriptive statistics → Explore). Are there any observations which have very large Cook's distance compared to the rest? What does this tell us about the effect of those particular observations?

TODO

##### Solutions

Ⓢ 

From the Figure below there seems to be one observation which is far more influential than the others. This is in fact observation 5 which we flagged as a potential outlier from consideration of the residual plots.

TODO

#### 22. Try refitting your regression model excluding particular individual observations which have large Cook's D values. Have the regression coefficients changed very much?

TODO

##### Solutions

Ⓢ 

Refitting the regression model without observation 5 does result in the regression coefficients changing for the interaction term and the enzyme test score term. Is this a better model for the remaining data? The $R^2$ value suggests not.
